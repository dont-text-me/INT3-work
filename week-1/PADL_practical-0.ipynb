    "*Machine learning* is a computational approach in which a system learns to map inputs to outputs by \"learning\" from training data. In reality, \"learning\" means *optimisation* (usually minimisation) of a *loss function*. In the case of *supervised learning* our training data provides pairs of inputs and the corresponding desired output. Our \"machine\" is a function of a particular form whose behaviour is determined by some parameters. Our job is to find the parameters that give a function that maps input to output such that the loss over the training set is minimised."

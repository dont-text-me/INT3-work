There are no fewer than 5 examples given in the [logistic regression section](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression) of the scikit-learn User manual. Feel free to look at all five but for sure look at the first two: L1 Penalty and Sparsity in Logistic Regression and Regularization path of L1- Logistic Regression. You will see that by default scikit-learn uses an L2 penalty (like in ridge regression) but it is also possible to use an\n",

    "Below is a straightforward re-implementation of logistic regression in PyTorch. Nearly all of this should now be very familiar to you. We put our logistic regression model in a superclass of `torch.nn.Module`. The model itself consists of a linear layer mapping 9 input features to 1 output. This is then passed through a sigmoid layer so that the model outputs probability of one of the two classes. Since we are doing binary cross entropy loss, we use `torch.nn.BCELoss` as our loss function (note: the sigmoid is applied inside the model so we don't use the version of the loss function that combines sigmoid and BCE - but this would be a perfectly valid alternative). We train as normal and evaluate on the test set. But this time, we threshold the output probabilities to make our final hard class decisions and compute the percent correct.\n",
